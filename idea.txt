Occasionally in the dungeons, among monsters and bones, you may encounter a cursed mechanism, a devil's toy

a slot machine

the truth is, Samuel was never the good guy. He was a hardened gambling addict, spending every pennie he's
gotten on gambling and betting, thus infuriating his father. And after Samuel lost their entire mansion to
a casino, father drew the line

After being kicked out, Samuel went to the death's domain to achieve immortality, for the sole purpose of
being able to gamble until the very end of the world. And occasionally placed slot machines taunt him,
taking his time and life, so that he'll never achieve his utmost dream

Or maybe he will?

***

So the idea is - you may encounter a special slot machine room, and you are able to use it once, and then it
breaks. The price is - you lose 50% of your max health, which means that you can actually kill yourself using
it lol. You'll then spin the slot machine with 3 sections, and depending on what you get you get different
outcomes

Sections are - danger, disease, riches, weapons, bones, magic
MAYBE TODO: add more

Danger - a couple of mobs drop on you
Disease - you lose health 
Riches - you get an item
Weapons - you get a temporary weapon
Bones - you get bones
Magic - grants effects until you die
